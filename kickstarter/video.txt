Beginning- Someone goes up to the sink pours out water drinks it then clutches his chest and dies
Turns gray- and someone says "=Do you know what's in your water? With Aperio, this wouldn't have happened

Hi my name is Max Diamond, he is Yash Sharma, he is Kevin Sheng, and he is Armaan Thapar and we are engineers at the Cooper Union and this is Aperio, a smart water faucet that 
makes sure your water is safe. As a collective unit, we've always had a passion for using our engineering skill to help others. We've been following recent events and there
have been many alarming incidents that have happened all over the world, even close to home, which highlights the need for effective water quality monitoring. So we went ahead
and developed a product that would do just that

Show Aperio device- 
Aperio is a standard water faucet with a suite of the latest high-end sensors that monitors the quality of your water that flows through your faucet. Aperio lets you
know about the quality of water through text, a smartphone application, or a read out on the advice. Aperio checks for heavy metals and pathogen contents but also for
Oxidation-Reduction Potential allowing for the device to give you our very own "purity score" through passing our sensing data through a well-tested algorithm. In addition, 
when your "purity score" reaches dangerous levels, Aperio will automatically alert you through one or more of the notification options of your choice. 

As we recognize that many households already have a faucet that they're already content with, we developed the Aperio micro to fit your needs. The micro has all of the sensing
capabilities of the Aperio faucet, and is simply attached to your existing faucet.
