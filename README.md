<h1>_Aperio_</h1>

Effortless Water Quality Monitor


<h2>_What is Aperio?_</h2>

How much do you know about the water that comes through your faucet? The water that you drink, the water that you use to clean, the water that you wash yourself with. Chances are, very little. This lack of transparency is alarming. That's where Aperio comes in.

Aperio - latin for "to reveal" - is a Spark Core powered "smart" faucet which actively monitors the concentration of contaminants that flow through it with a suite of sensors in real time, giving a constant indication of water quality. This data is then uploaded online via Wi-Fi.

Eliminate uncertainty. Regain confidence in the water you consume, and take comfort in the fact that you know exactly what you are putting in your body.
