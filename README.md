<h1><a href="http://goo.gl/TDbZAM">Aperio, an effortless water quality monitor</a></h1>


<h2><i>What is Aperio?</i></h2>

How much do you know about the water that comes through your faucet? The water that you drink, the water that you use to clean, the water that you wash yourself with. Chances are, very little. This lack of transparency is alarming. That's where Aperio comes in.

Aperio - latin for "to reveal" - is a Spark Core powered "smart" faucet which actively monitors the concentration of contaminants that flow through it with a suite of sensors in real time, giving a constant indication of water quality. This data is then uploaded online via Wi-Fi.

Eliminate uncertainty. Regain confidence in the water you consume, and take comfort in the fact that you know exactly what you are putting in your body.

Potential Sensors
<ul>
<li>Salinity- 							#easy and cheap to implement</li>
<li>pH- 									#easy to implement, on the expensive side, usefulness is questionable for tap water.</li>
<li>Turbidity- 							#easy and cheap to implement, not all that useful.</li>
<li>Conductivity- 						#difficult and expensive to implement, can be replaced by orp.</li>
<li>Heavy Metals- 						#difficult and expensive to implement, can be replaced by orp.</li>
<li>Dissolved Oxygen- 					#not as difficult to implement, expensive, not all that useful for residential applications.</li>
<li>Oxidation-Reduction Potential- 		#easy to implement, expensive, but can be very useful for determining water quality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>Full faucet to incorporate sensors easily. Water flows into sensor chamber before valve, where sensors detect quality and send data to Spark Core. Flow meter detects power-on parameters. Flow based generator could also be potentially included. First prototype made with PVC. Second will probably incorporate 3D printing and CAD.</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>Spread website and facebook page to other students and schools via social networks. Create mailing list to obtain real data and gain feedback.</p>
<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<p>Minimize cost and maximise ease of use. No one will purchase if it is too much hassle/expense for too little gain. Choose which sensors are necessary and eliminate those that aren't to save real estate and reduce cost. We need to make a device that people will actually want to buy.</p>
