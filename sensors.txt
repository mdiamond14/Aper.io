pH 								              	#moderatly difficult to implement, on the expensive side, usefulness is questionable for tap water.
Turbidity 					          		#easy and cheap to implement, not all that useful except in areas susceptible to turbid water (Not NYC).
Conductivity/Salinity 						#easy and cheap to implement, can be replaced by orp.
Heavy Metals 					          	#difficult and expensive to implement, some functionality can be replaced by orp.
Dissolved Oxygen 				        	#moderatly difficult to implement, very expensive, not all that useful for residential applications.
Oxidation-Reduction Potential 		#moderatly difficult to implement, expensive, but can be very useful for determining water quality.
