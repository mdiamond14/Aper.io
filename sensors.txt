Salinity 							#easy and cheap to implement
pH 									#easy to implement, on the expensive side, usefulness is questionable for tap water.
Turbidity 							#easy and cheap to implement, not all that useful.
Conductivity 						#difficult and expensive to implement, can be replaced by orp.
Heavy Metals 						#difficult and expensive to implement, can be replaced by orp.
Dissolved Oxygen 					#not as difficult to implement, expensive, not all that useful for residential applications.
Oxidation-Reduction Potential 		#easy to implement, expensive, but can be very useful for determining water quality.
